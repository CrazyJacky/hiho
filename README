HIHO: Hadoop In, Hadoop Out
Connector for Hadoop

This branch is for support for HIHO on Apache Hadoop pre 0.21. HIHO has a dependency on the DataDrivenDBInputFormat
and other db related code in the apache Hadoop 0.21 branch. However, 0.21 is still not production ready and a lot of our clients want 
HIHO to work with the earlier versions. This branch does precisely that.
